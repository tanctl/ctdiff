# Tools
Script for testing ctdiff
## attack_demo.sh
Comprehensive timing attack demonstration script.
```bash
cd /path/to/ctdiff
./examples/tools/attack_demo.sh
```

Runs various attack scenarios:
1. Comprehensive attack analysis
2. Early vs late changes attack  
3. Similarity detection attack
4. Version control attack simulation
5. Basic file comparison demo
6. Detailed timing analysis with csv export

Generates `timing_report.txt` and `timing_data.csv` for analysis.
